# Tic Tac Toe in C++ ❌⭕

## About
This is a **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** for two players, written in **C++**. It features a clean 3x3 grid interface where players take turns marking spaces with X and O. The game automatically detects wins, draws, and validates user input. This project demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts including loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Two players take turns entering numbers (1-9) to place their marks on the board
- Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If all spaces are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw

---

## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ Clean 3x3 grid display with numbered positions
- ✅ Two-player turn-based gameplay
- ✅ Automatic win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- ✅ Draw detection when board is full
- ✅ Input validation to prevent invalid moves
- ✅ Clear display of current board state after each move
- ✅ Modular code structure with separate functions
